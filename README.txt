Piccolo uses C++11, make sure to have a compliant compiler.

To install, we need to create a build directory, and a release directory
in it:

	mkdir -p build/release

Then, simply run make.

	make

Piccolo will be compiled. The program will be in the build/release folder.
Run piccolo with no option to have a short guide.
